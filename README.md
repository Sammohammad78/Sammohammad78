## 🏗️ About & focus

I work at the intersection of **Revit**, **Dynamo**, and **data** for prefab and housing systems.  
Most of my work centres on:

- **Revit workflow automation** – joins, sections, dimensions, and cleanup driven by explicit rules  
- **Prefab housing systems** – rule-based detailing, controlled variants, and reusable building blocks  
- **Parametric façades** – panel grids and schedules designed with fabrication in mind  
- **5D / CPQ logic** – geometry tied directly to quantities, cost, and planning  
- **Drawing → data pipelines** – turning BIM into structured information for procurement and production

**How this actually shows up day-to-day**

- Revit 2024/25 for modelling, prefab detailing, and productised housing systems  
- Dynamo 2.19+ / Dynamo 4.0 (CPython3 / PythonNet) for automation graphs and rule engines  
- Python / pyRevit for reusable tools, QA checks, and batch operations  
- APS / Forge + Power BI for exposing BIM data and building reports around it  
- n8n for connecting BIM outputs into wider digital workflows

## 📁 Highlights

### 🧩 Dynamo tools for model consistency
Automation for joins, section alignment, and dimension strategies so models follow **rules** instead of personal habits.

### 🏠 Prefab & 5D prototypes
CPQ-style setups where prefab components drive **quantities, cost, and planning** from a shared logic base.

### 🧱 Parametric façade logic
Grids, panels, and BOM-ready outputs designed so geometry, schedules, and fabrication data stay in sync.

## 🌍 A bit human

Hello — English, العربية, Türkçe, Nederlands.  
I treat automation as a way to **reduce variation**, remove rework, and let systems carry the complexity.  
Consistent systems create consistent projects.
